themebg
=======

The `themebg` package provides a single function which creates a custom theme for ggplot2 plots. The theme is loosely based on graphic design principles established by Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, and others. By default, the panel background is blank, gridlines are removed, and axis colors are grey to minimize distraction from the data.

Installation
------------

The `themebg` package can be installed from GitHub using the `devtools` package and the following commands:

``` r
library(devtools)

install_github("bgulbis\themebg")
```
